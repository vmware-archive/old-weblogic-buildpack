# preferAppConfig - Use the App bundled configs over the buildpack bundled configs?
# If set to true, all configs and scripts packaged with the app bundle will be used for domain and server creation.
# If set to false, the buildpack bundled configs and scripts would be used except for the domain name and jvm configs.
# The domain name/credentials and the jvm configs would still be referred from the app bundle even if preferAppConfig is set to false.
# The rest of the configs and startup scripts would be pulled from buildpack
preferAppConfig: true

# serverInWlxMode - Start the WLS Server in Limited Runtime footprint mode
# If true, this would disable JMS, EJB and JCA layers and result in smaller memory footprints.
# If false, this would start the server in full blown mode - enabling JMS, JCA and EJBs.
